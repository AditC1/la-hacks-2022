    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>College Waitlists Work Against Low Income Students.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Many colleges utilize waitlists in order to keep themselves within their financial aid budget.</li>
          <li>In other words, students who do not request financial aid and instead pay the full tutition have a higher chance of getting in.</li>
          <li>In 2008, Reed, a small liberal arts college in Oregon, considered financial need in the first round of admissions. But when it turned to the waitlist, it only accepted students that were able to pay. - Forbes</li>
